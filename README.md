## Overview

UniChain - Reflection System

"Ra" is a reflection and projection system for all blockchains, enabling users to interact seamlessly as if they were operating in a single, unified blockchain environment. Ra serves as a virtual reflection or projection of various blockchains, allowing users to monitor, simulate, and trigger transactions across different chains. Transactions are initiated from Ra, but the actual execution takes place on the original blockchain.

Key Features

	• Unified Blockchain Experience: Ra provides a "UniChain" interface through which users can interact with multiple blockchains via a single system. This interface abstracts the complexities of individual chains.
	• Transaction Triggering: Ra enables the triggering of actual transactions on the original blockchain through interaction with Ra's reflection. Users can initiate payments and other blockchain activities from Ra, which are then securely executed on their respective blockchains.
	• Real-time Reflection: Ra reflects the state of blockchains in real-time, providing an accurate and efficient way to monitor blockchain environments without putting load on the original networks.
	• Cross-chain Support: Ra is designed to support multiple blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and more. This allows users to interact with various blockchain ecosystems from a single platform.
    • The ultimate goal of Ra is to simplify blockchains.

How It Works

	1. Blockchain Reflection: Ra creates a reflection (or mirror) of each supported blockchain. These reflections represent the state of the original chains and allow for read-only or simulated interactions.
	2. Transaction Simulation and Execution: Users can simulate transactions within Ra's reflection environment. Once confirmed, transactions are securely executed on the original blockchain, maintaining the underlying chain's security and reliability.
	3. UniChain Interface: The UniChain interface abstracts Ra's reflections into a unified experience, allowing users to interact with the system as if it were a single chain. Ra handles all necessary communication with the original chains behind the scenes.

Installation

To get started with Ra, clone this repository and follow the setup instructions below:

git clone https://github.com/brief69/ra.git
cd ra

Prerequisites

	• Node.js
	• Docker (for local blockchain instances if needed)
	• Other dependencies as specified in package.json

Installation

Install the required packages:

npm install

Running the Application

To launch Ra, use the following command:

npm start

For additional details on configuration and setting up blockchain reflections, refer to the configuration guide.

Usage

	1. Set up Blockchain Reflections: Add and configure the blockchains you want to reflect in config.json. See the documentation in docs/ for detailed instructions on connection and API setup for supported chains.
	2. Interact with UniChain Interface: Once Ra is running, access the UniChain interface at localhost:3000 to manage and monitor blockchain activities.
	3. Trigger Transactions: Use the UniChain interface to initiate transactions. Ra will handle transaction processing and reflect it on the original blockchain upon execution.

Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please read our contribution guide to get started. We appreciate all feedback and suggestions to make Ra a powerful tool for blockchain interaction.

Roadmap

	• Add support for additional blockchains
	• Implement advanced transaction monitoring and notifications
	• Integrate with other cross-chain protocols for increased compatibility
	• Develop an SDK for easy integration with other projects
